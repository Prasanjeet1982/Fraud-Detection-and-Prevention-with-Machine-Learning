# Fraud Detection and Prevention with FastAPI

This project demonstrates a Fraud Detection and Prevention system using FastAPI. The system predicts whether a given transaction is fraudulent or not based on transaction data.

## Introduction

The Fraud Detection and Prevention system uses a trained machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent. The project is built using FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python. The model is trained on historical transaction data and is used to classify new transactions as fraudulent or not.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fraud-detection-fastapi.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd fraud-detection-fastapi
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the FastAPI application, use the following command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Once the server is running, you can access the API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## API Endpoint

The API exposes a single POST endpoint for predicting fraudulent transactions:

- **Endpoint**: `/predict/`
- **Method**: POST
- **Request Body**: JSON object with transaction data (see [Data Format](#data-format))
- **Response**: JSON object with the prediction result

## Data Format

The transaction data format for the request body is as follows:

```json
{
  "amount": 123.45,
  "merchant": "Online Store",
  "location": "City"
}
```

## Deployment with Docker

You can deploy the Fraud Detection and Prevention system using Docker. Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine.

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t fraud-detection-app .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 fraud-detection-app
   ```
